This project uses a custom Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn in the banking sector. The dataset used in this project is Churn Modelling.csv from Kaggle.The model determines whether a customer will:
1) Leave the bank (close their account)
2) Continue as a customer

**Key Features:**
1) Data preprocessing and feature engineering
2) Custom ANN model built with TensorFlow/Keras
3) Model training, evaluation, and visualization
4) Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix
